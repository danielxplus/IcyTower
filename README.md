# Icy Tower

## Project Overview
Icy Tower is a freeware video game by Swedish game developer Free Lunch Design. It is a platform game set in a tower, 
where the player's goal is to jump from one "floor" to the next and go as high as possible without falling and plunging off the screen.
This project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) game built using **C++ and SFML**. The game features a dynamic environment, character animations, and an engaging gameplay loop.

### Our Project Includes
- **Factory Pattern** for object creation
- **State Pattern** for animations and player movement
- **SFML for rendering and input handling**
- **Custom Asset Manager** for handling textures, sounds, and fonts
- **Dynamic Camera System**
- **Menu with interactive buttons and sound effects**

### Known Issues & TODOs
We've had some minor issues in our project, which we'll work on with time. These issues include
- [ ] Slow game load-in from the menu
- [ ] X'ing out mid-game might cause a crash
- [ ] Introduce enemies which were not pushed to the game yet
